                    We all want to live forever, right?
                        </br>
                        Wrong.
                        </br>
                        Think about watching your family die as you selfishly carry on, your children aging and passing, your grandchildren, and so on.
                        Think of all the friends you’ll make, but eventually lose.
                        </br>
                        You don’t want that! No!
                        </br>
                        You know the earth is eventually going to be swallowed by the sun, right? And one day, you would be present for this greatest of all apocalypses.
                        As fascinating as this would be, scientifically speaking, this excitement would fade as the pain of thousand-degree flames engulfed your tender body,
                        and your aged mind would be so alone in this interminable torture.
                        </br>
                        Does this sound like something you want? We didn’t think so.
                        </br>
                        Immortality is stupid. Think before you wish.
